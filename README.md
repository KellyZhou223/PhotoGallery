# PhotoGallery
As a pastime, I love exploring new places in my city. When I explore new places, I often like to document my experiences and look back at them in the future.
This is a dynamic photo gallery showing different foods and places I have visited in New York City. I made this photo gallery so I could share my adventures around the city. Feel free to take a look!
